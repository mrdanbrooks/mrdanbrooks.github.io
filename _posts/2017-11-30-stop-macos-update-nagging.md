summary: Put an end to the requests to update your OS.

There are lots of good reasons why you might not want to upgrade to the latest operating system. Or at least not right away.

- There are usually security problems that have yet to be resolved.
- Some of your software might break.
- Upgrading doesn't work as well as you want it to - you would be much better off blowing everything away and installing the new OS from scratch.

That said, one of the "features" of MacOS that I resent the most is the constant nagging to upgrade whenever a new OS comes out. I'm pretty sure the reason for this is that Apple is cheap and lazy, and doesn't like providing support and security updates to multiple versions of their OS, which they feel compelled to change every year for reasons that I am unable to appreciate. 

Fortunately, Kif Leswing at Business Insider has found a way to make the nagging go away.

- Go to system preferences -> App Store
- Uncheck "Automatically check for updates" and also "Download newly available updates in the background"
- Then go to your applications folder and look for "MacOS HighSierra Installer". Delete it - you can download it again later. It takes up nearly 5GB of space anyways.
