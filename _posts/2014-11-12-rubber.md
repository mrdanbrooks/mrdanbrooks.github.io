Wish that your latex editor had version control built into it, or that it had vim commands?

Using a program called rubber you can easily build latex documents from the command line, which means we can integrate it into vim!

Install rubber using macports

```
sudo port install rubber
```

and add the following to your `.vimrc` file

```vim
au FileType tex command Make :!rubber --pdf --warn all %
au FileType tex command Clean :!rubber --clean %
au FileType tex inoremap " ``''<ESC>hi
au FileType tex set spell spelllang=en_us
```

This adds the commands ``:Make`` and ``:Clean`` for tex files, as well as adds smart quotes (when you type ``"`` it automatically inserts \`\`'') and spell checking!

But what about the automatic document previews that come in TexShop and TexMaker? 
Good news everyone, we can do that too! Grab a copy of the document viewer [Skim](http://skim-app.sourceforge.net/). 
Go to _Skim_ > _Preferences_ > _Sync_  and enable _Check for file changes_. 
Now, when you update the PDF file, the document will automatically be reloaded.

And finally, to add icing to the cake grab Tim Pope's [Git Fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) and Andy Stewarts [vim-gitgutter](https://github.com/airblade/vim-gitgutter).
