Assuming you already have tripwire installed, here are the basic commands used for checking up on the status of your machine.


## Check system integrity 
This is usually run as a cronjob, but can also be run manually.

```
sudo tripwire --check
```

## Update tripwire database
This should be done anytime the system is updated, software is installed or removed, or configuration files are changed.
Otherwise, if something changes how will you know if it is your change or someone elses changes?

```
sudo tripwire --update --twrfile /var/lib/tripwire/report/previous_report.twr
```
