summary: Finding your identity, when you loose it.
---

I recently lost my identity on my macbook.
The first sign of trouble was when I tried to ssh into one of my servers.

```
$ ssh username@myserver.lan
You don't exist, go away!
```

Well that's interesting. I wonder if my co-workers are screwing with me...
Let's open a second terminal window here...

```
I have no name!@macbook $
```

ORLY?

```
$ whoami
501
```

That doesn't sound good. 

```
$ id
uid=501 gid=20(staff) groups=20(staff),401(com.apple.access_screensharing),12(everyone),33(_appstore),61(localaccounts),79(_appserverusr),80(admin),81(_appserveradm),98(_lpadmin),100(_lpoperator),204(_developer)
```

I apparently no longer have a user name?
And it doesn't look like i'm in ``/etc/passwd`` either. 
Let's try something more apple specific.

```
$ dscl . read /users/myusername uid realname
dsAttrTypeNative:realname: bob
dsAttrTypeNative:uid: 501
```

Ok, well at least someone remembers me.
After some googling, I found [someone else](http://www.hochschule-trier.de/index.php?id=12677) having the same struggle as me.
Only they were able to fix it by repeatedly typing in ``sudo -s`` like a crazy person until it magically worked.
This solution, of course, only works for crazy people - it did not work for me.

Apparently the problem can happen if you use LDAP to log in, and DNS does not resolve correctly.
I don't use LDAP, but they also say something similar can happen if you are using NFS, which I also don't use.

Finally, someone with [zero upvotes on a stack overflow page](http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/122478) has a suggestion that works for me.

```
$ dscacheutil -flushcache
$ whoami
bob
```

Fixed? 

```
$ id
uid=501(bob) gid=20(staff) groups=20(staff),401(com.apple.access_screensharing),12(everyone),33(_appstore),61(localaccounts),79(_appserverusr),80(admin),81(_appserveradm),98(_lpadmin),100(_lpoperator),204(_developer)
```

I guess so.
This is probably a sign of bad things to come...
