Wish that your latex editor had version control built into it or had vim commands?

Using a program called rubber, you can build latex easily from the command line,
and that means we can build it into vim!

Install rubber using macports

```
sudo port install rubber
```

Edit your `.vimrc` file

```vim
au FileType tex set makeprg=rubber\ \-\-pdf\ \-\-warn\ all\ %
au FileType tex command Make :!rubber --pdf --warn all %
au FileType tex command Clean :!rubber --clean %
```

Now, while you are editing your latex file in normal mode, just type `make` and _poof_, your latex file is built!

But now you miss your automatic document previews that you had in TexMaker. 
Good news everyone! We can do that too! Grab a copy of the document viewer [skim](http://skim-app.sourceforge.net/) (sorry, OSX only). 
Go to _Skim_ > _Preferences_ > _Sync_  and enable _Check for file changes_. 
Now, when you update the pdf file, the document will automatically be reloaded.

And finally, to add icing to the cake grab Tim Pope's [Git Fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) and Andy Stewarts [vim-gitgutter](https://github.com/airblade/vim-gitgutter).
